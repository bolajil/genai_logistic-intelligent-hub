## Slide 1: Title Slide

**GenAI Logistics Intelligence Hub (GLIH)**  
**Transforming Cold Chain Operations with AI**

*Automated Anomaly Detection • Document Intelligence • 24/7 Decision Support*

---

## Slide 2: The Challenge

### Lineage Faces Critical Operational Challenges

**Labor Volatility**
- Difficulty maintaining consistent staffing
- High turnover, extensive training required
- Manual processes prone to delays and errors

**Cold Chain Disruptions**
- Temperature breaches risk spoilage and compliance
- Manual response takes 30-45 minutes
- Inconsistent SOP adherence

**Food Waste**
- $5M+ annual losses from spoilage
- Delayed anomaly response
- Poor visibility across shipments

**Operational Inefficiencies**
- 55+ minutes per invoice/BOL processing
- Fragmented systems, manual data entry
- Limited real-time visibility

---

## Slide 3: The Solution - GLIH Platform

### GenAI-Powered Automation for Cold Chain Excellence

**Three Core Capabilities:**

1. **Automated Anomaly Detection**
   - Real-time temperature and location monitoring
   - Instant SOP retrieval and action recommendations
   - <5 minute response time (vs. 30-45 minutes manual)

2. **Document Intelligence**
   - Semantic matching for invoices, BOLs, customs forms
   - Auto-detection of discrepancies
   - 80% faster processing (55 min → 11 min)

3. **Natural Language Operations**
   - Ask questions in plain English
   - Unified view across all systems
   - Zero training required

---

## Slide 4: Live Demo - Natural Language Query

### "What are the temperature requirements for seafood?"

**System Response (2 seconds):**
```
The expected temperature range for seafood is -2°C to 2°C.

• If temperature exceeds 4°C for >30 minutes: Immediate inspection required
• If temperature exceeds 7°C for >1 hour: Product disposal required
• Quality team notification required for all breaches
```

**Citations:** 3 relevant SOPs retrieved automatically

**Impact:** 
- Operations team gets instant answers
- 100% SOP compliance
- No searching through documents

---

## Slide 5: Live Demo - Anomaly Detection

### Critical Temperature Breach Scenario

**Event:**
- Shipment: TX-CHI-2025-001 (Seafood)
- Temperature: 8.5°C (Expected: -2 to 2°C)
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Location: I-80 near Des Moines, IA

**Automated Response (2.5 minutes):**

1. **URGENT**: Immediate inspection for spoilage
2. **URGENT**: Alert quality team
3. **HIGH**: Quarantine shipment pending approval
4. **HIGH**: Generate compliance incident report

**Manual Process:** 45 minutes  
**GLIH Automated:** 2.5 minutes  
**Time Saved:** 95%
