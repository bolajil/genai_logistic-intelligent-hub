## Use Case Demonstrations

### Use Case 1: Temperature Breach Response

**Scenario**: Seafood shipment experiences temperature breach en route to Chicago

**Current Process** (Manual):
1. Sensor alert received by ops team (5-10 min delay)
2. Ops manually looks up shipment details (5 min)
3. Ops searches for relevant SOP (10 min)
4. Ops decides on action and notifies stakeholders (10 min)
5. Documentation created manually (15 min)
**Total Time**: 45 minutes

**With GLIH** (Automated):
1. Sensor alert triggers AnomalyResponder agent (real-time)
2. Agent retrieves shipment details and SOPs (30 sec)
3. Agent generates action recommendations (30 sec)
4. Agent notifies stakeholders automatically (30 sec)
5. Compliance documentation auto-generated (30 sec)
**Total Time**: 2.5 minutes

**Impact**:
- **95% faster** response time
- **100% consistent** SOP adherence
- **Zero manual effort** for routine breaches
- **Full audit trail** for compliance

---

### Use Case 2: Document Matching

**Scenario**: Invoice received for shipment, needs matching and validation

**Current Process** (Manual):
1. Invoice received via email (manual check)
2. Ops manually searches for matching shipment (10 min)
3. Ops compares invoice details to BOL (15 min)
4. Discrepancies investigated manually (20 min)
5. Approval or escalation (10 min)
**Total Time**: 55 minutes per invoice

**With GLIH** (Automated):
1. Invoice auto-ingested from email
2. Semantic search matches to shipment (5 sec)
3. Auto-extraction and comparison (10 sec)
4. Discrepancies highlighted with recommendations (5 sec)
5. Auto-approval or escalation (5 sec)
**Total Time**: 25 seconds

**Impact**:
- **99% faster** processing
- **95%+ accuracy** in matching
- **$50K+ annual savings** from error prevention
- **Instant visibility** into discrepancies

---

### Use Case 3: Natural Language Operations

**Scenario**: Ops manager needs shipment status during shift handoff

**Current Process** (Manual):
1. Log into multiple systems (WMS, TMS, tracking)
2. Search for shipment by ID
3. Check temperature logs manually
4. Review incident reports
5. Compile information for handoff
**Total Time**: 10-15 minutes per query

**With GLIH** (Natural Language):
1. Ask: "Where is shipment TX-CHI-2025-001?"
2. GLIH retrieves unified status (2 sec)
3. Ask: "Any temperature issues?"
4. GLIH shows breach history with resolutions (2 sec)
5. Ask: "Generate shift handoff summary"
6. GLIH creates comprehensive report (5 sec)
**Total Time**: 10 seconds

**Impact**:
- **99% faster** information retrieval
- **Zero training** required (natural language)
- **Unified view** across all systems
- **Instant handoff reports**
